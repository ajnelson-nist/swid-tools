# Software Identification (SWID) Tag Validation Web Application

This submodule provides an example SWID validation Java web application. This web application is a wrapper around the [SWIDVal](../swidval) tool.

The source for this tool is found in this repo and can be built using Apache Maven as follows:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

This will produce a WAR file which can be deployed to a Java application server.
